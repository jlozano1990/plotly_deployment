# BioDiversity
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of bacteria within different test subjects' belly buttons. We then deploy this project on to GitHub Pages so anyone can take a look at it.
## Results
We allow our users to decide what specific test subject they would like more information on through a drop down menu. We then show that test subjects' data to viewers in various ways. The information about the test subject is presented in a dashboard. We also use bar charts, a meter to show frequency, and a bubble plot. This allows users to view the information available in different ways so they can further analyze it more easily.
